# web3 challenge
Build a basic front-end that connects to the Ethereum blockchain with a [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) wallet, and makes function calls to a smart contract. The app should display your ETH address and balance, along with a button to increment, decrement, and get the count. 

You may use React or Angular for the front-end.
The smart contract code and the ABI are complete and provided in this repository.
You can deploy the smart contract on a local network or use any of those deployed on the testnets. The addresses are provided below.
